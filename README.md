# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview

This project predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using machine learning techniques.  
The goal is to build a classification model based on passenger attributes such as age, gender, ticket class, fare, etc.

This is an end-to-end machine learning project including:
- Data preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Model training
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Model evaluation

## 📊 Dataset Information

The dataset is taken from the Kaggle competition:

Titanic – Machine Learning from Disaster

Source: Kaggle  
The dataset contains passenger information such as:
- PassengerId
- Pclass
- Name
- Sex
- Age
- SibSp
- Parch
- Ticket
- Fare
- Cabin
- Embarked
- Survived (Target Variable)

Target Variable:
- 0 → Did Not Survive
- 1 → Survived
